# Library-Management
I have created a project on Library Management. It caters the day to day entry of books and members of the library. For the user interface I have used tkinter library of Python and for storing the records I have used MySQL. 
To run the file successfully please follow the steps
install python idle and mysql shell(command line client)
Then install the following libraries via cmd through the commends
i)  pip install PILLOW
ii) pip install mysql
iii) pip install pymysql
Make sure both python idle and sql are added to path
